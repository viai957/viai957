Here are some ideas to get you started:

I'm a Deep Learning aficionado with an interest in leveraging the power of algorithms and mathematics to solve realworld problems. Lately, it's been over a year since I immersed myself in the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs), a
journey perhaps measured in light-years in the age of GenAI. I've been exploring every aspect of the technology stack
from delving into the intricacies of low-level (PyTorch) implementation to orchestrating abstraction layers. My journey
often takes me through the complex world of mathematics, where I aim to bring clarity to intricate ideas. Whether I'm
building code from the ground up or refining algorithms in GitHub repositories, my focus is on demystifying these
sophisticated models. Along the way, I'm always reminded of the fine line between science and art, recognizing that their
successes owe as much to hard work as to fortunate discoveries. The time spent optimizing LLMs has deepened my
appreciation for human evaluation more than ever before.

### ðŸ“• My Latest Projects:
<!-- LIST:START -->
- [LexiGenesis ](LexiGenesis ) An repo to explain and understand how the evolution of LLM goes from pretraining -> finetuning -> benchmarking -> deplyment -> application development over it
<!-- LIST:END -->
